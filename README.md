# Git Practice
this is my repo for demonstrating practicing git

## Workflow
1. Go to https://github.com/new and make a new repo
2. Select any options for readme, license, or gitignore and click OK.
3. Go to the green "Code" button on GitHub and copy the git address that looks like git@github.com:ryanorsinger/git_practice.git
4. Now, navigate on your computer to the folder you want to be the parent folder and type `git clone git@github.com:ryanorsinger/git_practice.git`
5. You can now do more work inside of this folder...

## To "Add, commit, and push" new content
1. Create a new file or edit an existing file
2. `git status` from your command line
3. `git add filename.txt` where filename.txt is the file you created or edited
4. `git status` to check to makesure that the filename is now green in your terminal
5. `git commit -m "this is the commit message that explains what I'm adding"`. 
6. `git push origin main` will upload all of your commits!
