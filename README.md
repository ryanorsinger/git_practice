# git_practice
this is my repo for demonstrating practicing git

## Workflow
1. Go to https://github.com/new and make a new repo
2. Select any options for readme, license, or gitignore and click OK.
3. Go to the green "Code" button on GitHub and copy the git address that looks like git@github.com:ryanorsinger/git_practice.git
4. Now, navigate on your computer to the folder you want to be the parent folder and type `git clone git@github.com:ryanorsinger/git_practice.git`
5. You can now do more work inside of this folder...
